<h1>d) Create a bookmarking app where you can save URLs. It should have a form where you enter the URL, a title, and a "tag". There should be a list of all the URLs, as well as a list of all the tags (this should be generated dynamically from the link collection). When you click on a tag, the link list should show only those tags. Hint: which tag is selected is "application state", so could appear in your URL and/or have a view model to represent it. You can filter a collection with collection.filter(...), but be aware that it returns an array of models, not a new collection.</h1>
